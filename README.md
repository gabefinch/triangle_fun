Triangle Fun
=========


About
-----

This repository is an one day javascript assesment for Epicodus:

  * Users can input the three sides of a triangle
  * The page will determine whether the triangle is possible
  * The page will determine whether the triangle is equilateral
  * The page will determine whether the triangle is isosceles
  * The page will determine whether the triangle is scalene
  * Eventually I would like the page to draw the triangle, but don't yet have that working
